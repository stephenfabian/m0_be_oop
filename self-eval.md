# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? *It felt good, I like bringing together different lessons all together to create a single piece of code.*
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? *Going well.  I took plenty of small breaks today which helped me feel relaxed for the live eval.*
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need? *I need to better establish some relationships outside of my small group to give me some more opportunities for diverse collaboration.*
